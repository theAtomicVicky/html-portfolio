 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Once upon a time in the west</h3>
 <p>Excellent movie, with a great soundtrack. The main character's revenge story is gut-clenching and Sergio Leone's music is awesome.</p>
 <h3>The Royal Tenembaums</h3>
 <p>Wes Anderson's movies are simply beautiful. This one I particulary like for reasons I have yet to unravel, maybe is the final realization that love between people who have hurt each other so much is greater than what we can either explain or understand.</p>
 <h3>Ghost In the Shell</h3>
 <p>I love animated movies, and really like anime. Old style anime has a great tone to it, and the animation feels just right. Not only that, but this one is a movie that forces us to question what does it mean to be human, and how far can we strecch the concept of it.</p>
